            Welcome to my website and project portfolio!
            Below is an audit of all my computer science projects.
            To find out more information about a particular project, click on its title below to see
            an example of my work in action.

        <a href="projects/2/index.html">
            Sudoku-Solving Artificial Intelligence & Algorithm Efficiency
        </a>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Through the Advanced Research Mentorship (ARM) program at Glastonbury High School,
        I worked with Laurent Michel, Ph.D., in the Department of Computer Science and Engienering
        at the University of Connecticut. By researching Crook's algorithm and the brute-force algorithm,
        I was able to write a Sudoku-solving program in C++ while utilizing recursive programming.

        <a href="projects/1/index.html">
            Puzzle Pride - An LGBTQ+ Educational Game
        </a>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hosted by the MassMutual Life Insurance company, I completed a six-week program devoted to
        encouraging students to pursue computer science at the collegiate level and was educated in
        robotics, graphics and animation, data structures, algorithms, and mobile app development.
        I developed a web application utilizing Processing.js and object-oriented programming to create
        a tile-swapping and reimaging game that educates users on LGBT communities and their pride flags.

            Atari Pong - Dynamics & Mutlimedia Aspects of Game Design
        </a>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Under the guidance of Theodore Raphan, Ph.D., in the Department of Computer and Information Science
        at Brooklyn College through a STEM program hosted through the Courant Institute of New York University,
        I researched the dynamics and multimedia aspects of game design. With object-oriented programming and
        the use of Processing.js, I re-created the Atari Pong game, also known as table tennis.
