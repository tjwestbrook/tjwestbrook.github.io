        Sudoku-Solving Artificial Intelligence & Algorithm Efficiency Â· 2016
    </header>
    <p>
        Through the Advanced Research Mentorship (ARM) program at Glastonbury High School,
        I worked with Laurent Michel, Ph.D., in the Department of Computer Science and Engienering
        at the University of Connecticut. By researching Crook's algorithm and the brute-force algorithm,
        I was able to write a Sudoku-solving program in C++ while utilizing recursive programming.
