        Puzzle Pride - An LGBTQ+ Educational Game Â· 2016
    </header>
    <p>
        Hosted by the MassMutual Life Insurance company, I completed a six-week program devoted to
        encouraging students to pursue computer science at the collegiate level and was educated in
        robotics, graphics and animation, data structures, algorithms, and mobile app development.
        I developed a web application utilizing Processing.js and object-oriented programming to create
        a tile-swapping and reimaging game that educates users on LGBT communities and their pride flags.
