            Welcome to my website and project portfolio!
            Below is an audit of all my computer science projects.
            To find out more information about a particular project, click on its title below to see
            an example of my work in action.

        <h1>Sudoku-Solving Artificial Intelligence & Algorithm Efficiency</h1>
        <p>
            Through the Advanced Research Mentorship (ARM) program at Glastonbury High School,
            I worked with Laurent Michel, Ph.D., in the Department of Computer Science and Engienering
            at the University of Connecticut. By researching Crook's algorithm and the brute-force algorithm,
            I was able to write a Sudoku-solving program in C++ while utilizing recursive programming.

    <div id="1" class="tabcontent">
        <h1>Puzzle Pride - An LGBTQ+ Educational Game</h1>
        <p>
            Hosted by the MassMutual Life Insurance company, I completed a six-week program devoted to
            encouraging students to pursue computer science at the collegiate level and was educated in
            robotics, graphics and animation, data structures, algorithms, and mobile app development.
            I developed a web application utilizing Processing.js and object-oriented programming to create
            a tile-swapping and reimaging game that educates users on LGBT communities and their pride flags.
        </p>

    <div id="0" class="tabcontent">
        <h1>Atari Pong - Dynamics & Mutlimedia Aspects of Game Design</h1>
        <p>
            Under the guidance of Theodore Raphan, Ph.D., in the Department of Computer and Information Science
            at Brooklyn College through a STEM program hosted through the Courant Institute of New York University,
            I researched the dynamics and multimedia aspects of game design. With object-oriented programming and
            the use of Processing.js, I re-created the Atari Pong game, also known as table tennis.
